### Currently:
I'm a university student at the <span style="color:#A67B5B"><strong>University of Piraeus</strong></span> studying <strong>Digital Systems</strong>.

## <span style="color:#A67B5B">Projects</span>

- **Config Matrix**  
  A web app designed to streamline and track the setup process of multiple computers through a simple, task-oriented interface.

- **OhShint (OSINT Multi‑Tool)**  
  Toolkit for open-source intelligence tasks—metadata extraction, username enumeration, social profiling, and optional password generation.

- **netscan (Network Scanner)**  
  Lightweight Python tool for discovering active hosts on a local network, mapping IP-to-MAC addresses, and conducting basic port scans for network exploration.

- **iOS App Development using SwiftUI** <em>(My emotional support programming language)</em><br>
  Swift is basically my <span style="color:#A67B5B">digital cozy blanket</span> when code gets tough—mostly because I can build <span style="color:#A67B5B">beautiful UIs</span> without actually being good at design (I’m more of a backend soul, let's be honest). From to-do lists to workout trackers, I build iOS apps with SwiftUI because sometimes all you need is a language that feels like a <span style="color:#A67B5B">hug in code form</span>.

## <span style="color:#A67B5B">Participation in the Greek National Informatics Competition</span>

- **37th PDP (Panhellenic Informatics Competition)**  (<a href="https://www.pdp.gr/" style="color:#A67B5B">Explore the official PDP competition site</a>)<br>With no prior experience in C, I taught myself the basics in just one week during Panhellenic exam prep—enough to advance to the second phase. It might not sound like much, but I’m proud of it!

## <span style="color:#A67B5B">Experience</span>

- **Junior Software Developer & Service Desk Technician** June–July 2025 (Summer role)  
Assisted troubleshooting and contributed to internal tool development, which gave me valuable exposure to both end-user support and backend systems.


## <span style="color:#A67B5B">Ongoing Training</span>

- **University Studies — University of Piraeus**  
  BSc in Digital Systems (in progress) — University of Piraeus (2025–present)

- **PCPP1 – Certified Professional Python Programmer 1** (Python Institute) – in progress  
  Advanced credential covering design patterns, network programming, database integration, automated testing, and clean code principles.

- **WDA – Certified Associate Web Developer** (JavaScript Institute) – next target  
  Focuses on web fundamentals—HTML5, CSS, responsive design, accessibility, and modern front-end practices.


## <span style="color:#A67B5B">Future Direction</span>
I'm currently considering a career path in either **cybersecurity** <span style="color:red">*(Red team)*</span> or **software engineering**, building scalable, secure applications across platforms.


## <span style="color:#A67B5B">Next Steps</span>
- Complete <strong>PCPP1</strong>, then <em>WDA</em>, with a focus on developing the foundation for web app pentesting.
