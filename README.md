### Currently:
I'm a <span style="color:#A67B5B"><strong>Junior Software Developer && service desk technician</strong></span>, working part time and <strong>awaiting admission</strong> to a Computer Science University in Athens (Panhellenic exams just completed)

## <span style="color:#A67B5B">Projects</span>

- **Config Matrix**  
  A web app designed to streamline and track the setup process of multiple computers through a simple, task-oriented interface.

- **OhShint (OSINT Multi‑Tool)**  
  Toolkit for open-source intelligence tasks—metadata extraction, username enumeration, social profiling, and optional password generation.

- **netscan (Network Scanner)**  
  Lightweight Python tool for discovering active hosts on a local network, mapping IP-to-MAC addresses, and conducting basic port scans for network exploration.

- **iOS App Development using SwiftUI** <em>(My emotional support programming language)</em><br>
  Swift is basically my <span style="color:#A67B5B">digital cozy blanket</span> when code gets tough—mostly because I can build <span style="color:#A67B5B">beautiful UIs</span> without actually being good at design (I’m more of a backend soul, let's be honest). From to-do lists to workout trackers, I build iOS apps with SwiftUI because sometimes all you need is a language that feels like a <span style="color:#A67B5B">hug in code form</span>.

## <span style="color:#A67B5B">Participation in the Greek National Informatics Competition</span>

- **37th PDP (Panhellenic Informatics Competition)**  (<a href="https://www.pdp.gr/" style="color:#A67B5B">Explore the official PDP competition site</a>)<br>With no prior experience in C programming, I self taught myself the very basics of C in arround a week (just enough for me to continue onto the second phase) during my Panhellenic exams preparation. For some it might not be much but im proud of that!

## <span style="color:#A67B5B">Ongoing Training</span>

- **PCPP1 – Certified Professional Python Programmer 1** (Python Institute) – in progress  
  Advanced credential covering design patterns, network programming, database integration, automated testing, and clean code principles.

- **JSA – Certified Associate JavaScript Programmer** (JavaScript Institute) – currently studying  
  Covers advanced JavaScript concepts: object-oriented patterns, asynchronous programming, generators, iterators, and functional techniques.

- **WDA – Certified Associate Web Developer** (JavaScript Institute) – next target  
  Focuses on web fundamentals—HTML5, CSS, responsive design, accessibility, and modern front-end practices.


## <span style="color:#A67B5B">Future Direction</span>

I'm currently considering a career path in either **cybersecurity** <span style="color:red">*(Red team)*</span> or **software engineering**, building scalable, secure applications across platforms.


## <span style="color:#A67B5B">Next Steps</span>

- Complete <strong>PCPP1</strong>, then <strong>JSA</strong> and <em>WDA</em>, with a focus on developing the foundation for web app pentesting.  
- Begin university studies in computer science in Athens.
